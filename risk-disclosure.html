      <p><strong>TRADING AND INVESTMENT INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF LOSS AND IS NOT SUITABLE FOR EVERYONE.</strong></p>

      <p>Zynx Corporation (in the process of registering as a Delaware LLC) provides access to trading accounts funded with private capital. The information and services offered on this website, including but not limited to AlphaTrade Global and Zynx Capital, are for informational and educational purposes only and do not constitute investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or a recommendation to buy or sell any securities, derivatives, or other financial instruments.</p>

      <h2>Key Risks You Must Understand</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Loss of Capital</strong>: You may lose some or all of the capital allocated to your trading account. Past performance is not indicative of future results.</li>
        <li><strong>High Volatility</strong>: Financial markets (forex, futures, cryptocurrencies, stocks, etc.) are highly volatile and can move rapidly in either direction.</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage Risk</strong>: Trading on margin or with leverage can amplify both gains and losses. A small market movement can result in significant losses exceeding your initial allocation.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Liquidity</strong>: Certain markets or instruments may have low liquidity, making it difficult to enter or exit positions at desired prices.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical & Operational Risks</strong>: Platform errors, internet disruptions, data feed issues, or execution delays may occur and result in losses.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory & Jurisdictional Risks</strong>: Trading laws vary by country. You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Zynx Capital accounts are funded with private capital provided by the company. No client funds are deposited or at risk. However, traders are still subject to strict drawdown rules, and violating these rules may result in immediate account termination without payout.
